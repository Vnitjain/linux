for those still having problems after instaling via pacman...

first put terminal into root by typing "su" and entering password.

then install virtual box

pacman -S virtualbox
then install the host modules by

pacman -S virtualbox-host-modules
then

dkms autoinstall
and then, while still as superuser.

type

modprobe vboxdrv
(it will execute as normal user but it wont work, unless your on terminal as root)

this should make it work

(had some problem just now.....fixed it with some help from this thread...so thought id update)
